# Section Height Testing Results

## Observations

### Hero Section
- The hero content (text, CTAs) is now centered vertically in the viewport
- The hero image appears below the fold as intended - you can see just the top edge of it
- This creates a nice "scroll to discover" effect

### Challenges Section
- Takes up a large portion of the viewport
- The 6 challenge cards are visible with good spacing
- Section has proper breathing room

### Overall
- The sections are now properly sized for desktop viewing
- Each section dominates the viewport for a clean, organized experience
- The CSS classes (section-hero, section-full, section-large, section-medium) are working

## Next Steps
- Push changes to GitHub
- Deliver to user
