## Hero Section Issues

### Typography
- [ ] Headline gradient text ("Without the costly headaches") has weak contrast - amber on white is hard to read
- [ ] Too many font weights competing - bold, semibold, regular all in close proximity
- [ ] Target audience line (amber text) competes with main headline
- [ ] Line heights feel inconsistent

### Spacing
- [ ] Status badge feels disconnected from headline (too much space above)
- [ ] Stats cards have inconsistent internal padding
- [ ] Gap between CTAs and stats section feels arbitrary

### Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] Three stat cards with one highlighted breaks the rhythm - either all equal or clear primary
- [ ] "See how I helped BANQloop" link feels orphaned
- [ ] Two CTAs of similar weight - unclear which is primary action

### Contrast & Color
- [ ] Amber gradient text on light background = accessibility concern
- [ ] Status badge green dot animation is distracting
- [ ] Yellow/amber highlight card breaks the visual flow

### Alignment
- [ ] Content feels left-heavy, right side has dead space
- [ ] Stats cards don't align with text blocks above

---

## Navigation Issues
- [ ] Logo area has two lines of text - feels cluttered
- [ ] "Start a Conversation" button in nav competes with hero CTA
- [ ] Nav links underline animation is unnecessary flourish

## Principles to Apply

### 1. Typography Discipline
- Establish clear type scale with purpose
- Reduce font weight variations
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Consistent line heights

### 2. Spacing System
- Use consistent spacing scale (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96)
- Create clear relationships through proximity
- Generous whitespace for breathing room

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
- One clear primary action per section
- Reduce competing visual elements
- Use weight and size, not color gimmicks

### 4. Color Restraint
- Amber as accent, not feature
- Dark text for readability
- Subtle backgrounds, not gradients

### 5. Remove Unnecessary Elements
- No decorative animations
- No gradient text (accessibility)
- No shimmer effects
- No floating decorations

## Challenges Section Issues

### Cards
- Yellow/amber icon backgrounds are too saturated and distracting
- Left border accent on cards is decorative noise
- Cards have inconsistent content lengths causing uneven grid
- Icon containers are oversized relative to content

### Typography
- Card headings in quotes feel gimmicky
- Body text is too light gray - poor contrast

### Layout
- Section has unnecessary warm background gradient
- Transition text at bottom is centered but cards are left-aligned grid

## Key Design Principles to Implement

1. **Remove all gradient backgrounds** - use flat, subtle tones
2. **Remove decorative borders and accents** - let content breathe
3. **Increase body text contrast** - slate-600 minimum
4. **Reduce icon prominence** - smaller, monochrome
5. **Consistent card heights** - equal padding, let content flow
6. **Remove animated elements** - static, confident design
7. **Single accent color usage** - amber for CTAs only, not decoration
8. **Tighter type scale** - fewer sizes, clearer hierarchy
