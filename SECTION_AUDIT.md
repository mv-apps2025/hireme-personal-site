- Mobile: Hamburger menu

**Hero Content:**

- Subheadline: Describes value proposition
- Process line: "Research → Design → Visualization → Production → Launch"

---

### Critical Analysis

#### UX Issues:
1. **Navigation lacks "About" or personal context** - Visitors don't know who Martin is until they scroll far down
2. **Two identical "Let's Talk" CTAs** visible (nav + hero) - redundant
3. **No clear indication of what type of professional** Martin is in the nav
4. **Hero image appears below the fold** - misses opportunity for immediate visual impact

#### UI Issues:
1. **Hero text is left-aligned but doesn't use full width** - right side is empty space
2. **Status badge is small and easy to miss** - should be more prominent for job seekers
3. **Proof points are plain text** - could be more visually impactful
4. **Hero image has no caption** explaining what it shows

#### Marketing Issues:
1. **Headline is generic** - "idea to market" doesn't differentiate from other designers
2. **No specific target audience called out** - who is this for? Startups? Enterprise? Hardware companies?
3. **No urgency or scarcity** - why should someone act now?
4. **Missing social proof in hero** - no logos, no quick testimonial snippet

#### Business Strategy Issues:
1. **Primary CTA is email** - no calendar booking option for higher conversion
2. **Resume download as secondary CTA** signals "job seeker" more than "expert consultant"
3. **No clear positioning statement** - what makes Martin different from other product designers?
4. **Missing "who I work with"** - visitors can't self-qualify

---

### Recommended Improvements

#### Navigation:
1. Add a brief tagline under the logo: "Product Designer & Manufacturing Strategist"
2. Consider adding "About" link for personal credibility
3. Make nav CTA more specific: "Schedule a Call" or "Start a Conversation"

#### Hero - Messaging:
1. **Sharpen the headline** to be more specific and differentiated:
   - Current: "Take your product from idea to market."
   - Better: "Ship hardware products faster. Without the expensive mistakes."
   - Or: "I help startups go from napkin sketch to factory floor."
   
2. **Add target audience qualifier**:
   - "For hardware startups, DTCs, and product teams who need to move fast."

3. **Make the value proposition more concrete**:
   - Instead of generic "help you move from where you are to where you need to be"
   - Use: "I've helped 500+ products reach manufacturing—catching costly mistakes before they happen."

#### Hero - Visual:
1. **Make proof points more prominent** - use icons or larger numbers
2. **Add a mini social proof element** - "Trusted by founders at [logo] [logo] [logo]" or a quick quote
3. **Consider a split layout** - text on left, hero image on right (above the fold)

#### Hero - CTAs:
1. **Primary CTA**: "Book a Free Call" or "Schedule a Conversation" (add Calendly integration)
2. **Secondary CTA**: Keep "Download Resume" but consider "View My Work" as alternative
3. **Add a third micro-CTA**: "See how I helped BANQloop raise $4M →" (scroll to case study)

#### Hero - Status Badge:
1. Make it larger and more prominent
2. Add specificity: "Open to Full-Time & Contract Opportunities in Tampa Bay"

---

### Implementation Priority:
1. Sharpen headline and value proposition (HIGH - immediate impact)
2. Add target audience qualifier (HIGH - helps visitors self-qualify)
3. Improve proof points visual treatment (MEDIUM)
4. Add social proof element (MEDIUM)
5. Consider Calendly integration for CTA (LOW - requires external setup)

## Section 2: Challenges

### Current State Analysis

**Section Label:** "COMMON CHALLENGES"
**Headline:** "Product development is hard."
**Subheadline:** "Here's where teams usually get stuck."

**6 Challenge Cards (3x2 grid):**
1. "We have an idea but don't know where to start"
2. "We need visuals that sell"
3. "Design and manufacturing don't talk"
4. "We're moving too slow"
5. "Our costs are out of control"
6. "We don't know how to launch"

**Closing line:** "The common thread? You need someone who can see the whole picture—not just one piece of the puzzle."

---

### Critical Analysis

#### UX Issues:
1. **No clear connection to Martin's solution** - Cards describe problems but don't hint at how Martin solves them
2. **All cards look the same** - No visual hierarchy to guide which challenge is most common or severe
3. **No interaction** - Cards are static; could benefit from hover states that reveal solutions
4. **Missing CTA** - Section ends without directing visitors to take action

#### UI Issues:
1. **Cards are plain white boxes** - Lack visual interest or differentiation
2. **No icons** - Text-only cards feel less scannable
3. **Quotes as headings feel awkward** - The quotation marks make it feel like someone else is speaking
4. **Gray background blends** - Section doesn't stand out enough from hero

#### Marketing Issues:
1. **Problem-focused without solution hint** - Good to agitate pain, but should plant seeds for solution
2. **Generic challenges** - Could be more specific to hardware/manufacturing context
3. **No emotional resonance** - Challenges are stated factually, not felt
4. **Missing cost/consequence** - What happens if these problems aren't solved?

#### Business Strategy Issues:
1. **No prioritization** - Which challenge is most common? Most costly?
2. **No segmentation** - Different visitors have different primary challenges
3. **Missing transition** - Should flow naturally into "here's how I solve these"

---

### Recommended Improvements

#### Content Improvements:
1. **Add icons to each card** - Visual anchors make scanning easier
2. **Add "The cost" or consequence** to each challenge - make the pain more real
