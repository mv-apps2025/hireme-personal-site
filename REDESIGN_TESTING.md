## Overall Assessment
The redesign successfully makes content larger and more impactful through:
1. **Larger typography** - Headlines and body text are significantly larger
2. **More generous padding** - Cards and sections have more breathing room
3. **Bigger interactive elements** - Buttons, icons, and avatars are larger
4. **Better visual hierarchy** - Clear distinction between heading levels

The content now naturally fills the viewport through good design principles rather than artificial height constraints.
